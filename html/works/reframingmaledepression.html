					<h1>Reframing Male Depression</h1>
					<h2>Pubic Health Campaign, Graphic Design, Print & Digital, Research-led design, Branding, Illustration</h2>
					<br>
					<h3>How can we reframe society's perspective on male depression?</h3>
					<p>For a majority of men, embarrassment, shame, and failure are the most common emotions associated to mental health help-seeking. Some men believe that there is a societal pressure for men to be ‘masculine’ which involves refraining from showing any emotion and fixing problems, even your own mental issues, on your own. As a result, although society is becoming a lot more open towards discussing mental health in a public setting, men still feel uncomfortable or are unwilling to address their depression at a personal level.<br><br>

					Through my Honours project, I studied the impact of using positive emotions, such as humour, hope, and joy in designing public health campaigns targeting male depression. Through research and experimentation, evidence exists that incorporating positivity in health campaign design encourages more men to tackle their depression as it is able to reframe the issue as something is approachable, normal to experience, and easy to treat. </p>

					<h3>Fighting depression.</h3>
					<p>A brand identity that revolved around the idea of ‘taking action’ was developed for the campaign. Men were found to be more likely to respond to material that portrayed depression as something that is physical and can be overcome through physical actions, rather than an illness that is purely mental. Phrases that inspired action such as “Fight male depression” or “Beat male depression” were used instead of “get help” or “seek help” to encourage more men to deal with their illness. To complement this, a graphic style was adopted into the campaign along with two superhero sidekicks featured in educational and humorous graphic novels to reinforce the idea of taking action. </p>

					<h3>Talk and learn!</h3>
					<p>Research has also found that men lacked the knowledge to properly address and discuss the issue of depression. There is a misconception that the treatment for depression is limited and to add to this some men even fail to identify the symptoms of the illness. To address this, a website was created to serve as a hub of relevant information surrounding the issue and to act as a gateway to an online community. Men can easily learn about the issue and dispel common misconceptions by visting the website. Additionally, men suffering from or who have suffered from depression can share their stories and converse with men that have gone through similar situations through the website.</p>
